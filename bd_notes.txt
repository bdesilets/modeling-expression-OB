To do:
figure out how to create GUI in python
open CV verses Scikit image (general & aligning images)(licencing)
conceptually figure out how to align images within specimen
complile annotated bibliography for reasources

python GUI --------------------------
What do I want it to look like?
window displaying an image, press arrow button to scroll through 
images


29 Aug 2018

Today I:
researched and begun to implement a method for scrolling 
through images using tkinter


To do next:
test with actual ABA images (hopefully its the right file type)
refactor MainGUI code into a nice neat class
get forward and back buttons working

30 Aug 2018

Today I:
tested next image button with ABA images (didn't work)
refactored
window open in fullscreen mode
have buttons for previous and next image
get ABA images to show on the screen (sometimes, its a work in progress)

To do next:
FIRST get one image to show
THEN make next/previous buttons to cycle through images
(I was trying to do this all at once and that wasn't going well)

4 Sept 2018

Today I:
For GUI:
made methods set_img_dir, display_image 
started on getting the next and previous buttons to work

For aligning images:
- OG images from ABA aren't the same size
- read on image feature detection and feature discription
https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_features_meaning/py_features_meaning.html#features-meaning
-OG images from ABA are too large, get DecompressionBombWarning
- currently trying to OG image in half (keeping th top half)

Image maipulation options
- Pillow
- Open CV
- Scikit Image
- Mahotas
- Scipy
- PythonMagick
- pycario
- SimpleITK

So what I need image manipulation for:
- detect line/blob in image
- crop image based on centering the glob


To do:
For GUI (switching focus now, come back to this later):
-get next and previous buttons to work, have to stop displaying
previous image and replace with the next images
-also have to fix window size when click/dragging the window 
- clean up code

This week:
switching focus to aligning images
image libraries and image detection
what assuptions are safe to make?
- perfectly alligned (good enough)
- same rotation or adjutments
- when are we making close enough decisions
one specimine that is perfectly lined up by hand (repeatable)
atomatic downlaod/crop
