TODO

Urgent
	- For the GUI, add key to show which colors correlate to which 
	genes, a scale bar for images, directions for selecting genes 
	to visualize, and add a way to change the minimum
	density threshold and window size during the process of 
	filtering expression.
	
	- automatic downloading/cropping

	- Align template images so that the OB is in the same place
	in each image

	- Align images within a gene set (rotate/translate)

	- Find template images that show no expression so that the
	colors from the expression map(s) do not become hard to see.

Efficiancy
	- We can make filter_expression more efficient by using a 
	“lawn mower” pattern when looping though all the pixels. This 
	way the window must only be created from scratch for the very 
	first pixel. When a new row is reached, the window must only be 
	altered by deleting and adding a row of pixels.
	
Better pratices
	- Currently, we must assume that all ISH images show gene 
	expression with the same RGB threshold values. Finding a better
	way to figure out possible RGB ranges would be useful.

	- Ideally, the filtered expression map images should be stored
	in binary to save on space. The ISH images in the ABA
	images folder should not be stored in binary. I think it is
	important that investigators using the program can refer to the
	original image.

	- Figure out an efficient way to convert a matplotlib 
	AxesImage (or an matplotlib image with cmap applied) to a PIL
	Image. Currently, we save it to a temporary file then read it 
	using PIL.

	- Currently, cv2 is only used to read images. To be concise
	and efficient, change the reading of images to PIL or 
	matplotlib. Fix any issues regarding image type that arise.
